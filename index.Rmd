## **💜 About myself**

I am an undergraduate student in Genomic Sciences with a strong interest in the molecular mechanisms of gene
regulation and host‑pathogen interactions. My research focus lies at the interface of molecular microbiology and
functional genomics,with particular emphasis on bacterial regulatory systems,nanomachines,and protein‑protein
interactions. I integrate experimental and computational approaches to address molecular mechanisms underlying
host‑pathogen interactions, and I have solid training in genetics, omics sciences, molecular and cell biology, bio
chemistry, machine learning and bioinformatics. I approach research with critical thinking, ethical responsibility,
and astrong commitment to scientific rigor, aiming to contribute to a better understanding of infectious diseases
and their impact on human health.

## **📚 Teaching Experience**

Since 2023, I’ve been working as a biology teacher in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AdmisionaUNAM/about"><span style="color:#515897;">**Admisión UNAM**</span></a> course. In this role, I collaborate with fellow university students to help prepare young learners who are striving to gain admission to some of the top universities in the country. Teaching is one of the things I love doing most—it’s an opportunity to share my passion for knowledge and be part of my students’ growth and development.

## **💌 Interests and Hobbies**

I love painting 🎨, writing ✍️, science communication 🔬, programming 💻, music 🎻, and volleyball 🏐.

***I’m always looking for new opportunities to grow, collaborate, and share science.***
