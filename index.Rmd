## **💜 About myself**

I am a Genomic Sciences student with a deep passion for researching the molecular mechanisms that govern life. I am driven by continuous learning and the exploration of new frontiers in science.

Although I am deeply interested in molecular biology, I am still exploring which research direction I would like to pursue, considering transcriptional regulation as one of the potential areas of focus. Additionally, I have a strong interest in astrobiology and the study of extremophiles, which are key to understanding life in extreme environments and its potential existence beyond Earth.
